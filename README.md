# News Popularity in Social Media Platforms (Facebook, Google+, LinkedIn)
## Final Delivery
### Artificial Intelligence (IART) - 3<sup>rd</sup> year of Integrated Masters in Informatics and Computing Engineering

In this project we analyze News Popularity on 3 major Social Media Platforms (Facebook, Google+, LinkedIn).
The used dataset is __parsed__, __processed__ and __graphs are plotted__ to help __interpret this giant amount of information__.

We use 3 machine learning models:
* K-nearest neighbors
* Support Vector Regression
* Neural Network

Using these models we try to predict the popularity of a new's item based on several features such as: _Topic_, _PublishDay_, _PublishHour_, _SentimentTitle_ and _SentimentHeadline_.

Also draw study the outcomes of these models, reaching conclusions stemming from their learning behaviour.

For this project we make use of the [*scikit-learn*](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) python module.

The dataset we used can be found [here](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/News+Popularity+in+Multiple+Social+Media+Platforms).
